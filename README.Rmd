## Abstract

Software for working with geographic data has long been used in transport planning.
Transport planning workflows have tended to separate the main data analysis stages from vital geographic processing and map making stages.
Data preprocessing and analysis stages are generally done in dedicated transport planning and spreadsheet software.
Geographic analysis and cartographic visualisation stages are generally done in a dedicated 'geographic information system' (GIS).
This paper explores how this situation has arisen due to historical specialisation and monopolisation of transport planning software, based on existing literature, before outlining an integrated approach that combines data analysis and geographic processing stages in a single workflow.
Three software ecosystems (QGIS, Python and R) are reviewed in detail; alternative current and potential future approaches, including 'cloud lock in' are discussed; and the relative merits of different approaches are discussed.
Building on this discussion, I argue that integrating data analysis and geographic processing in a single analysis has major advantages and outlines concrete steps that researchers, public sector transport planners, and transport planning analysts and consultants can use.
The paper concludes that 'integrated approach' can support efficient, scalable and reproducible transport planning workflows which can provide a strong and transparent evidence base needed for rapid transition away from fossil fuels in the transport sector.
